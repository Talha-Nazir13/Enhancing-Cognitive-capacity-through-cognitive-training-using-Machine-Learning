<h1>Enhancing Cognitive Capacity through Cognitive Training using Machine Learning</h1>

<p>This project explores enhancing cognitive capacity by training individuals on cognitive tasks. Using brain ECG signals, we employ various machine learning models to classify and analyze data.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objective:</strong> To improve cognitive capacity through cognitive task training using machine learning algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Data:</strong> ECG brain signals from two sources: Training and Control groups.</li>
  <li><strong>Models Used:</strong> Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Data preprocessing including scaling and concatenation of features.</li>
  <li>Implementation of various machine learning models for classification.</li>
  <li>Confusion matrix, accuracy scores, and classification reports for evaluation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Clone the repository and install the required libraries:</p>

<pre>
<code>git clone https://github.com/Talha-Nazir13/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data used in this project includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ECG brain signal data from both Training and Control groups.</li>
  <li>Data is loaded from <code>.mat</code> and <code>.npz</code> files, which are combined for analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Load the data using the provided scripts in the notebook.</li>
  <li>Run the machine learning models to classify the data and evaluate performance using confusion matrices and accuracy scores.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>NumPy</li>
  <li>Scikit-learn</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  <li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Key metrics such as accuracy and classification reports are generated for each model. The models are evaluated for their effectiveness in distinguishing between the Training and Control groups based on brain ECG signals.</p>
